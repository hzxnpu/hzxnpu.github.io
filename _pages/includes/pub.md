[Two Time-Scale DRL for Service Caching and Task Offloading in Cross-Domain Marine Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11106467) \\
**Zhaoxiang Huang**, Zhiwen Yu, Liang Wang, Yingnan Zhao, Huan Zhou, Bin Guo

- With increasing computational demands and limited network resources in marine environments, efficient service caching and task offloading have become critical. In such environments, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) rely on Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) as relays, forming a cross-domain network comprising underwater acoustic and above-water RF links. However, the heterogeneity in bandwidth, latency, and bit error rates introduces challenges for reachability analysis and delay estimation. This paper addresses the joint optimization of caching, task offloading, and resource allocation in a cross-domain marine network composed of offshore base stations, USVs, and AUVs.

[Erasure Coding-Based Cost-Optimized and Latency-Aware Data Storage in UAV-Enabled Edge Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11105766/) \\
**Zhaoxiang Huang**, Zhiwen Yu, Liang Wang, Huan Zhou, Erhe Yang, Bin Guo

  - UAV-enabled edge storage systems provide data storage services to users by deploying UAVs in areas lacking infrastructure coverage, overcoming delay limitations and improving Quality of Service (QoS). Most existing studies focus on storing replicas on UAVs to ensure low-latency data access. Nonetheless, replica-based strategies incur high storage cost, posing significant challenges for UAVs with limited storage resources. In this paper, we introduce erasure coding into the UAV-enabled edge storage system, aiming to reduce user data access latency while minimizing storage cost.

[Energy-Efficient Multi-AAV Collaborative Reliable Storage: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10902582/) \\
**Zhaoxiang Huang**, Zhiwen Yu, Zhijie Huang, Huan Zhou, Erhe Yang, Ziyue Yu, Jiangyan Xu, Bin Guo

  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) crowdsensing, as a complement to Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS), can provide ubiquitous sensing in extreme environments and has gathered significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we investigate the issue of sensing data storage in UAV crowdsensing without edge assistance, where sensing data is stored locally in the UAVs. In this scenario, replication scheme is usually adopted to ensure data availability, and our objective is to find an optimal replica distribution scheme to maximize data availability while minimizing system energy consumption.
