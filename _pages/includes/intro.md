I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiwen Yu](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/yuzhiwen.html). Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from Liaoning University in 2021.

My current research interests include mobile crowdsensing, mobile computing, and edge storage. My related work has been published in prestigious international journals such as IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC), IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoTJ), and IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (TNSM). If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
